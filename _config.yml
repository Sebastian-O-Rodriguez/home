# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.
